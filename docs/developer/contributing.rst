Getting the code
##############

Clone the repository from git via, change into the new directory and install the dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ git clone https://github.com/vojtajina/testacular.git
  $ cd testacular
  $ npm install

  # Run the tests with grunt
  $ grunt 

Now go and code awesome stuff. I'll wait until you're finished.

Finished? Great. Here are some guidelines before you push it to the repo.

Guidelines
##########

* Create one branch per feature/fix and name it ``fix-`` or ``feature-`` followed by a short name of what you are implementing
* Follow http://nodeguide.com/style.html (with exception of 100 characters per line)

* Send a pull request requesting a merge to ``master`` branch

.. warning:: 
  
  Don't send the pull request to the default branch ``stable``.
